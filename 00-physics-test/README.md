## Intro to 3D Physics
The goal was to make a 3D physics scene without using any tutorial.

I ended up making a ball-rolling scene.

I found myself interested in shaders in Godot. It has an excellent editor for shaders, offering visual and code editors with a live preview.

#### Learned:
I already had an experience with 2D physics systems (Godot, Unity) and 3D physics in Unity.\
3D physics is relatively easy once you understand 2D physics components (i.e. Rigid Body, Collision Shape, Area).
